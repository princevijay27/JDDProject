Based on the contents of the Discount DAO whitepaper, here is an overview of the project architecture, including the necessary contracts, their connections, and additional details:

### 1. Contracts Required

#### Governance Contract

- _Description:_ Manages the overall governance of the Discount DAO, including voting on proposals and risk parameters.
- _Key Functions:_
  - Proposal creation and voting
  - Adjustment of risk parameters such as debt ceilings, stability fees, and liquidation ratios
  - Time-weighted voting based on the lock duration of DD tokens

#### Vault Contract

- _Description:_ Handles the collateralization and minting of the DM stablecoin.
- _Key Functions:_
  - Accepts collateral deposits (e.g., ETH, WBTC)
  - Mints DM stablecoin based on deposited collateral
  - Manages liquidation processes if collateral value falls below the required threshold

#### Stablecoin Contract (DM)

- _Description:_ Represents the DM stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar.
- _Key Functions:_
  - Minting and burning of DM tokens
  - Maintaining the peg to the US dollar through collateral management

#### Auction Contract

- _Description:_ Manages the auction process for collateral liquidation and surplus distribution.
- _Key Functions:_
  - Conducts collateral and surplus auctions
  - Handles bidding processes for both collateral sales and surplus DM

#### Product and Service (P&S) Token Contract

- _Description:_ Issues tokens redeemable for products and services from partner businesses.
- _Key Functions:_
  - Issuance of P&S tokens at a discounted value
  - Redeemable value management pegged to $1
  - Facilitates buybacks and arbitrage services for businesses

### 2. Connections Between Contracts

#### Governance Contract and Vault Contract

- The Governance Contract sets risk parameters for the Vault Contract, such as debt ceilings and stability fees. It also oversees the minting and liquidation processes managed by the Vault Contract.

#### Vault Contract and Stablecoin Contract

- The Vault Contract mints DM stablecoins upon receiving acceptable collateral. It also interacts with the Stablecoin Contract for burning DM during liquidation or repayment processes.

#### Auction Contract and Vault Contract

- The Auction Contract conducts collateral auctions when a vault becomes undercollateralized. It interfaces with the Vault Contract to manage and transfer collateral and DM during the auction process.

#### Product and Service (P&S) Token Contract and Stablecoin Contract

- P&S tokens are integrated with the DM stablecoin, allowing businesses to issue and redeem tokens for their services. The Stablecoin Contract ensures these tokens can be minted and managed alongside DM.

### 3. Additional Details

#### Risk Parameters

- The Discount DAO Governance oversees key risk parameters for vaults, including debt ceilings, diversification ratios, stability fees, liquidation ratios, and penalties【7:1†source】【7:2†source】.

#### Voting Mechanism

- Voting within the DAO is time-weighted, providing more influence to tokens locked for longer durations. This mechanism incentivizes long-term commitment to the DAO【7:0†source】【7:3†source】.

#### Collateral Auctions

- The collateral auction process involves two phases: the first phase raises DM to cover the system's debt, and the second phase seeks to return as much collateral as possible to the vault owner. This system ensures efficient collateral management and minimizes losses for vault owners【7:2†source】.

#### Integration with Businesses

- The DAO assists businesses in issuing P&S tokens, which are sold at a discount and redeemable at face value. The DAO also provides arbitrage services to help businesses maintain the peg of their tokens to $1, ensuring stability and trust in the system【7:3†source】【7:4†source】.

These components and their interactions form the core architecture of the Discount DAO, facilitating decentralized governance, stablecoin management, and integration with partner businesses for product and service token issuance.
